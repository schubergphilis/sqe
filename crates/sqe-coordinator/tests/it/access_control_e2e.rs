//! Access-control end-to-end tests against a live Polaris + Ranger + Keycloak
//! stack (`quickstart/polaris-ranger-keycloak`).
//!
//! Run them with:
//!
//! ```text
//! scripts/access-control-test.sh
//! ```
//!
//! which brings up the stack subset these tests need and sets `SQE_AC_E2E=1`.
//! Every test is `#[ignore]`d AND gated on that variable: `scripts/
//! integration-test.sh` runs `cargo test -p sqe-coordinator -- --ignored`
//! against a DIFFERENT stack and must not force-run these. When the variable IS
//! set and the stack is unreachable the tests fail rather than skip. A gate that
//! passes when it never ran is worse than no gate.
//!
//! What is asserted here that the shell harness
//! (`quickstart/polaris-ranger-keycloak/test.sh`) cannot: exact masked values,
//! exact row counts, and denial-versus-typo discrimination (the same SQL is run
//! as a privileged user to prove the identifier is valid).

/// Skip-or-run gate. Returns early when the suite was not opted into.
